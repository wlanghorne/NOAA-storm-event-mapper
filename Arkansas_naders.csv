It took shape as a tropical depression on the morning of August 25th just southeast of Haiti, and rapidly strengthened to hurricane status by the morning of August 26th. After inflicting serious damage on portions of Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba, Gustav entered into the southeastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico and took aim at the Gulf Coast of the United States. Although Gustav attained Category 4 status earlier in its life, Gustav eventually made landfall as a strong Category 2 system at Cocodrie, Louisiana, on September 1st, containing maximum sustained winds around 110 mph. Gustav slowed down and weakened as it continued on its northwest track across southern Louisiana where major damage was inflicted. The pace of the system continued to slow dramatically over the next few days as it turned gradually to the right around a large ridge of high pressure over the Southeast. The remnants of Gustav finally began moving rapidly away from the Lower Mississippi Valley on the 4th as an incoming disturbance deflected it to the northeast. Gustav was responsible for multiple hazardous weather elements across the service area such as tropical storm force winds, tornadoes, flash flooding, and areal flooding from extensive rains.||As the center of Gustav crossed much of southern Louisiana, tropical storm force winds extended into southern Mississippi and portions of east central Louisiana. Sustained winds were between 35 and 45 mph with higher gusts between 70 and 100 mph occurred. Tree and power line damage was extensive across these areas which resulted in widespread power outages, some of which lasted for 3 to 5 days.||As Gustav slowed across central Louisiana, the outer rainbands continued to rotate across much of southern and central Mississippi. This kept those portions of Mississippi in the region which was favorable for tornadoes. Over 3 days, 26 tornadoes were confirmed, all of which were in the EF0 to EF1 range.||As Gustav slowed on September 2nd, flash flooding became a major issue which lasted into the 3rd as the storm slowly lifted to the north and northeast. The first round of heavy rain and flash flooding was across portions of southeast Mississippi as the outer rainbands started to move across the same areas. Total rainfall across this area was between 4 and 7 inches. The heaviest rains fell across areas near and west of the Mississippi River. Some of the Mississippi counties boarding the river received 8 to 11 inches of rain. Areas west of the river across Louisiana and southeast Arkansas saw extreme rainfall. Many locations received between 11 and 20 inches of rain. The highest measured rainfall was at Larto Lake where 21 inches fell. The flooding rains had a tremendous impact on area crops. Crop damage was extensive across Louisiana and western Mississippi. The flooding rains came at a crucial time as most crops will be harvested in September. Crop damage from Gustav will range between 300-400 million dollars.",Emergency Manager witnessed a brief tornado touch down just north of Lake Village.,CSV

Cold air aloft associated with this trough resulted in steep lapse rates such that isolated severe thunderstorms developed over portions of East Texas and Southwest Arkansas throughout the morning and afternoon, where instances of large hail were reported. These storms diminished during the late afternoon, but a deepening upper level trough sweeping southeast across Oklahoma and Arkansas reinforced a cold front southeast across the Southern Plains and Ozarks region, where a complex of showers and thunderstorms developed by mid and late afternoon over these areas and quickly progressed southeast into the Four State Region. Despite the showers and thunderstorms that affected the area earlier in the day, instability remained adequate especially over East Texas, Southeast Oklahoma, and adjacent sections of Southwest Arkansas. As large scale forcing increased ahead of the trough, thus tapping into this unstable air, a squall line progressed southeast through all of the region during the late evening through the early morning hours on April 29th, producing widespread reports of damaging winds and large hail. A couple of isolated tornadoes also touched down across McCurtain County Oklahoma, with one tornado remaining on the ground from Eastern McCurtain County into Northcentral Sevier County Arkansas. These storms exited Southwest Arkansas during the early morning hours of April 29th.","This is the continuation of the Eastern McCurtain County EF-2 tornado. This tornado snapped and uprooted numerous trees along Kellum Road in Northwest Sevier County, and continued to touch down intermittently several times as it tracked southeast. It touched down again along Bellah Mine Road as it crossed DeQueen Lake, with additional trees snapped and uprooted along Story Creek Road and DeQueen Lake Road. Minor metal roof damage to a garage of a home also occurred in this area. The damage swath broadened as the tornado approached Highway 71, when it crossed Crosstrails Road, damaging the roofs of two chicken houses while uprooting and snapping numerous trees. The tornado continued on to cross Highway 71 where numerous trees were snapped, a single-wide mobile home was rolled and destroyed, and the roof of a farm building was partially damaged. The tornado snapped approximately ten more trees before lifting just south of Highway 71/371 several miles east of DeQueen just east of the intersection of Farm to Market Road. Although the tornado will be rated an EF-2 with estimated maximum winds near 125 mph, found in Eastern McCurtain County Oklahoma, the tornadic damage in North-central Sevier County was estimated to be EF-1, with estimated maximum winds up to 105 mph.

The home was thrown 15 to 20 feet and destroyed. Another mobile home was destroyed along Ashley 128 Road. The tornado then crossed Highway 82 near Ashley 301 Road. Power poles were broken here and a tractor shed was heavily damaged. From this point, the tornado mostly paralleled Highway 82 or tracked along it. Many power lines were down along with poles. Just east of Ashley 912 Road, one wooden high tension segment had the top broken out. In the Snyder community, some homes sustained roof damage and had trees down on them. North of Highway 82, near Horseshoe Lake, a lot of hardwood trees were heavily damaged and there were three segments of the wooden high tension poles and lines taken out. The tornado continued roughly along Highway 82 toward Montrose. The strongest core of the tornado remained north of the highway and downed two more wooden high tension segments before Montrose and two more just north of town to the west of Highway 165. In the town of Montrose, numerous trees were damaged along with many homes having some degree of roof damage or a handful more with a tree on the home. Just east of Montrose, near the Chicot County line and north of Highway 82, a metal high tension pole segment was taken down which supported the highest wind estimate of 130 mph.

Five electrical power poles were downed along Highway 144, as well as another trailer getting rolled to near the bottom of Lake Chicot.  The tornado continued to snap large limbs and uproot hardwood trees as it moved across Pecan Ridge Drive. The tornado continued to just north of Levee Road where it lifted, but not before a few uprooting hardwood trees and snapping small to medium sized limbs. It is important to note that a large swath of severe wind speeds resulted in widespread downed trees on Lakehall Road, Sunnyside Road, Stuart Island Road and at the Lake Chicot State Park. Several of these trees fell on power lines causing outages to a large portion of the Lake Village community.

This trough allowed for the return of much warmer temperatures and a return of Gulf of Mexico moisture, replacing a cold continental arctic air mass the Southern Plains had been under the influence of the week before. By afternoon, dewpoints were in the lower 60s as far north as the Middle Red River Valley of Northeast Texas, Southeast Oklahoma and Southwest Arkansas. This yielded CAPE values around 500 J/KG but very strong Deep Layer Shear was present along with strong low level directional shear. Storms ignited during the late afternoon and early evening hours of January 21st across Northern Texas and Southern Oklahoma along and just ahead of a dryline. Later in the evening, low level directional shear continued to increase and therefore, storms took on the form of supercells. Some of these storms produced large hail and damaging wind gusts. One long track supercell resulted in a tornado which did damage across portions of Bowie County Texas before crossing the Red River and continuing into Little River County Arkansas. The Pacific cold front in association with the upper level trough eventually caught up with the dryline moving into Northeast Texas and Southeast Oklahoma during the overnight hours of January 21st and into the predawn hours of January 22nd, but this broken line of thunderstorms was not responsible for any additional wind damage, hail, or tornadoes across Southwest Arkansas.","An EF-1 tornado with maximum estimated winds between 100-110 mph touched down on the Legacy Ranch along County Road 1 in Southern Little River County, bending the fence, stripping the siding and roofing material on a large barn, and flipping two semi trailers on their side.

This includes several homes in the Random Acres subdivision near the Oklahoma border where shingles were blown off many roofs.  Trees and power lines were blown down throughout the tornado's path.Some of the tornado's worst damage occurred at the Fort Smith Regional Airport, where eight private and corporate airplanes were damaged, including three single-engine planes that were flipped.  Four of the planes that received the most damage were outside hangars.  The storm also damaged nine hangars, including three corporate and six general aviation facilities.  The weather observer at the airport officially recorded a tornado, and the ASOS at the airport measured a peak wind gust of 57 kts (66 mph) at 1244 AM.Otherwise, seven thousand residences in the south part of Fort Smith lost power in the storm.  Sutherland Central Distribution Center on US Hwy 71 lost several metal buildings and had some roof damage.  Reeder Simco Truck Center on south Zero Street had its showroom glass blown in, and a tractor-trailer was turned over.  A photo in the Southwest-Times Record daily newspaper showed cleanup efforts from a large tree that had fallen into a home's driveway in the 6800 block of S. Seventh street.",PDC

It first developed over Sequoyah County in Oklahoma and then moved into northern Crawford County around 715 PM CDT.  From there, it developed very rapidly and began rotating, finally producing a tornado touchdown near Lake Fort Smith.  Besides a tornado, this storm also produced hail to the size of golfballs.

Thankfully, there were no known tornadoes in Sebastian County, but the storm produced hail as large as golfballs.

Very unstable air and strong wind shear east of the dry line supported supercell thunderstorm structures, which persisted as the storms moved into northwestern Arkansas late in the evening. These severe storms produced tornadoes, large hail, and damaging downburst wind across portions of northwestern Arkansas. One of the tornadoes was especially intense, resulting in considerable damage to several towns as well as three fatalities in Franklin County.","This is the fifth of six segments of this tornado. The tornado crossed the Arkansas River, moving back into Franklin County from Logan County. The tornado crossed Carbon Plant Road and W Creek Road, destroying a mobile home and killing another person. It continued northeast across the town of Denning where it destroyed numerous permanent homes and mobile homes. At least 10 injuries occurred in Denning as the mile-wide tornado moved through the town. Several of these injuries were serious or critical and one of the victims died from her injuries on June 14th. She was in one of the many mobile homes that were destroyed in town. Ten 100-foot metal power poles were bent over at the ground by the tornado and many other power poles were snapped throughout the Denning area. Many large trees were also snapped or uprooted.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening. The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 21 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 21, 11 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities. This marks the first EF-5 tornado in Mississippi since the Candlestick Park tornado on May 3, 1966, and this marks the first time since statistics have been kept that two EF-5 tornadoes have been recorded on the same day in Mississippi, with the tornado in Smithville also rated as EF-5.

A large and powerful storm system took shape as a deep surface low tracked across Kansas and into portions of Iowa. This strong area of low pressure was driven by a powerful upper level trough which supported very strong winds through the entire atmosphere. These winds were felt at the surface to some degree as a large area across the Lower Mississippi River Valley saw sustained winds between 25-35 mph with gusts between 40-50 mph. Those gradient winds, in advance of the severe weather, were strong enough to down some trees and power lines across the region. Those damage reports were more scattered in nature.|Those strong winds from the deepening surface low helped to draw northward moisture and instability. The strong winds allowed for the environment to become highly sheared. Basically, there were increasing winds with height and a change in the wind direction as well. This particular combination of instability and high shear was quite rare. However, this set the stage for a severe weather outbreak which included numerous reports of damaging winds, large hail and a few tornadoes.",This tornado was observed briefly on the ground in North Crossett.

While there were many individual storms in the area on May 4, the most outstanding storm of the day was a supercell thunderstorm that spawned a tornado in Sequoyah County, OK, which then moved northeast for 39 miles to near Fayetteville.  Other storms produced damaging winds and large hail.","A significant long-track tornado first touched down 4 miles west of Short, OK, and tracked 39 miles to a point about 7 miles southwest of Fayetteville, AR.  Along the way, this tornado passed through portions of four counties but mainly affected sparsely-populated areas.  It reached its peak strength as an F3 tornado in extreme southeast Adair County, OK, but mainly caused F2 damage in Washington County, AR.  Fortunately, this tornado lifted before it reached heavily-populated Fayetteville.  The tornado's first real property damage took place at a property between the Hogeye and Strickland communities, where the tornado peeled off the roof to a home, shattered windows, uprooted trees, destroyed two barns, and wiped a porch off of its stone foundation.  Numerous trees were blown down along County Roads 212 and 214.  Only a few miles away in the Cove Creek community, south of Prarie Grove, the tornado blew off a home's roof, demolished an enclosed garage, and destroyed a barn.  A flagpole was bent almost in half, and a road sign ended up wrapped around a mailbox.  The tornado uprooted a 200-year old walnut tree which then fell onto a pickup truck.  About a half-dozen other oak and cedar trees on one property dating back at least 150 years were snapped or uprooted.  The Washington County Judge's Office supplied a picture of a church near Cove Creek that was moved off of its foundation.  Several poultry buildings along the tornado's path were also damaged.The property damage listed in this entry is for just that damage sustained in Washington County, while the F-rating reflects the tornado's peak strength in Adair County, OK.",PDC

You guessed it...the sky was falling again. Rain plus runoff from the soaking on the 8th/9th in northern and central Desha County inundated farms toward Halley (Desha County) in the south. At 200 pm CDT, an irrigation canal east of Pickens (Desha County) was breached, and adjacent farmland became a lake. The canal was patched by evening. At Florence (Drew County), residents were forced to use boats to get around. Water threatened structures at Dermott and Eudora (both in Chicot County), and sandbagging was in progress. It was clear that assistance was needed, and Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency. ||All was quiet quiet in Little Rock (Pulaski County) on the 10th, and the sun was out.

A creek was out of its banks just southeast of Timber Ridge (Pulaski County).||There was high water along Highway 114 between Calmer and Rison (both in Cleveland County), Highway 425 near Yorktown (Lincoln County), Highway 293 east of Garrett Bridge (Lincoln County), Highway 46 not far from Ebb (Grant County), Highway 276 on the south side of Stuttgart (Arkansas County), and Highway 1 at Kelso (Desha County). These highways were eventually closed temporarily.||The situation was the most serious in Desha and Drew Counties, and a Flash Flood Emergency was issued for the communities of Dumas, Pickens, Rohwer (all in Desha County), and Winchester (Drew County) at 1142 am CDT on the 8th. Radar estimated 10 to more than 15 inches of rain, and there was water everywhere. Some folks indicated (through social media) they had never witnessed flooding of this magnitude.||From an historic perspective, Rohwer (Desha County) received 9.25 inches of rain in the twenty four hour period ending at 700 am CDT on the 8th. This was the most rain in one day at the site, and the fourth largest one day total across the state in June. If that was not enough, 9.97 inches of liquid was measured the next day! Adding the numbers, the whopping 19.22 inches on the 8th/9th was the second biggest two day amount in Arkansas. It was just behind the 21.45 inches at Danville (Yell County) on December 3-4, 1982.||Relentless cloudbursts continued to start the 9th in eastern Arkansas. A rain gauge near DeValls Bluff (Prairie County) completely filled (to six inches) between 400 am and 700 am CST. Buildings were flooded and cars were stalled in Clarendon (Monroe County). It was the same story in Humnoke (Lonoke County), and sandbags were ordered to stop the water.||It was just getting worse in Stuttgart (Arkansas County), with one picture showing more water in a home than ever before (in the life of the photographer/42 years). That claim was likely true because the 7.50 inches of rain that caused the problem easily surpassed the previous one day June record of 4.07 inches on the 29th in 1939. At least fifteen homes were impacted by flooding at Altheimer (Jefferson County). Highway 302 from Highway 17 to Highway 79 was shut down in Monroe County, as was Highway 15 near Sherrill (Jefferson County), Highway 33 east of Tollville (Prairie County), and Highways 85 and 318 near Oneida (Phillips County).||As the weather calmed down in the east by the afternoon of the 9th, temperatures warmed well into the 80s to around 90 degrees across the northern and central counties. Heating and lots of humidity were enough to fuel isolated strong to severe storms toward evening.||Just after 700 pm CDT, a video showed a tornado (rated EFU) that lasted two minutes in a field near Blakemore (Lonoke County). Between 700 pm and 800 pm CDT, there was quarter size hail just east of College Station (Pulaski County). Little Rock (Pulaski County) got a quick 1.10 inches of rain. Trees were blown down at Cave City (Sharp County). At 805 pm CDT, there was a brief weak tornado (rated EF0) a few miles southeast of England (Lonoke County).||The focus shifted back to the southeast early on the 10th. You guessed it...the sky was falling again. Rain plus runoff from the soaking on the 8th/9th in northern and central Desha County inundated farms toward Halley (Desha County) in the south. At 200 pm CDT, an irrigation canal east of Pickens (Desha County) was breached, and adjacent farmland became a lake. The canal was patched by evening. At Florence (Drew County), residents were forced to use boats to get around. Water threatened structures at Dermott and Eudora (both in Chicot County), and sandbagging was in progress. It was clear that assistance was needed, and Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson declared a state of emergency. ||All was quiet quiet in Little Rock (Pulaski County) on the 10th, and the sun was out. For the first time in 2021, the temperature touched 90 degrees (the high was 92 degrees), and it was three weeks late (it normally happens by May 18th). Toward evening, it got loud toward Pinnacle Mountain (Pulaski County). A severe storm pumped out quarter size hail, winds strong enough to push over a few trees, and up to six inches of rain in less than two hours. The terrain accentuated the flow of water across roads and into neighborhoods.",Jefferson County EM reported a tornado between Tucker and England.

While the majority of the severe weather occurred out of the NWS Jackson, MS service area, several reports of large hail and wind damage were reported along with a few tornadoes. One of the strongest storms moved east across Ashley County Arkansas. This storm produced an EF2 tornado over the southwest and southern sections, and contained a swath of quarter to golf ball sized hail which occurred across the entire length of the county.||In looking at this event, which occurred over two days (April 9-10), in a regional view, this was likely the biggest severe weather and tornado outbreak during the spring of 2009. This event contained numerous strong tornadoes along with hundreds of large hail reports which stretched from the Southern Plains to several other southern States.","The tornado tracked across rural southern Ashley County and snapped and uprooted hundreds of large hardwood and softwood trees. Forty two homes were damaged with approximately 15 homes that were heavily damaged or destroyed. The most intense damage was along Meridian Church Road in southwest Ashley County. Here, intense tree damage resulted in several cross roads being blocked by dozens of trees, and several mobile homes and houses were destroyed by the winds and fallen trees. This was the area rated EF2 with 130 mph winds. Over the last several miles of the track, the tornado was narrower and damage was primarily in the EF1 category.",CSV

While warm moist air from the Gulf of Mexico filtered north and encompassed the region, a series of potent upper level disturbances began lifting northeast across the Lower Mississippi River Valley. This set the stage for multiple rounds of torrential rains that fell almost continuously across the ArkLaMiss from March 8th through March 12th. These prolonged torrential rains resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding across the region, with numerous area rivers reaching moderate and major flood stages. Floodwaters damaged numerous homes, businesses, and closed many primary and secondary roads across the region, with some secondary roads washed out. ||As the storm system finally exited the region late on the 12th, another fast moving, compact storm system followed in its wake during the evening of March 13th. This system brought another round of heavy rain to the Delta region, in addition to several reports of hail and damaging straight line winds. Tornadoes were spawned by this system as well, which included one that affected Chicot County.","This tornado started on the southwest side of Dermott just west of Buckner Lane. Here several trees were snapped. As it crossed Buckner, six power poles were taken down. It then crossed Trotter Street, where more trees were snapped with others uprooted. A fence was laid down as well. A few homes here had minor roof damage where shingles were blown off. The tornado then tracked across US Highway 165 where it moved through open field. It tracked into the South Delta Regional Correctional Facility. Quite a bit of damage was done to the facility as it took a direct hit. Several large sections of the outer fence were torn down. Five buildings on the south side of the complex sustained roof damage where shingles and sheet paper were removed. The gym building, a metal structure, was heavily damaged where a large section of wall was removed. The main building of the complex suffered roof damage where roughly half of the roof was lifted or had parts removed. The roof is not a typical roof; it has several layers. Large portions of the foam insulation were pulled out along with several sections of a thin roof covering. A couple of the guard watch towers had the windows blown out and some minor damage. One employee was injured trying to exit a tower and broke a leg. The tornado then moved into a wooded area, where trees were snapped and a metal carport was thrown and destroyed. As the tornado crossed Highway 35, many more trees were damaged. One home sustained minor roof damage on the south side of the highway. The tornado crossed US Highway 65 and snapped more trees. It then continued through a large wooded area and farmland and it moved into Desha County. It then crossed Highway 159 where many more trees were snapped and uprooted. Where it crossed Highway 159, a home sustained some minor roof damage and had the wood framed shed destroyed. A few power lines were down here as well. The tornado continued northeast into a wooded area where more trees were damaged. Though the tornado likely dissipated a bit farther east, no access was available to that area due to flooding. The total path length was 9.2 miles, with 2.6 miles of that in Desha County. The maximum estimated winds were 105 mph.",CSV

A series of potent upper level disturbances crossed the region through the 31st, bringing a rapid increase in wind aloft and resulting in an unstable environment that contained high levels of wind shear. These factors set the stage for flash flooding and several rounds of severe weather. Widespread severe weather occurred with a mix of damaging winds, up to golf ball sized hail, and tornadoes. Two EF-1 Tornadoes occurred in Chicot County, one of which resulted in an injury.
